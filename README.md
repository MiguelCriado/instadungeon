# instadungeon
Instadungeon is more like a sandbox for procedural dungeons generation than an actual game. It works as a canvas in which anyone can inject their dungeon generation algorithm via lua scripting.

It was made as a final project for my Software Engineering master's degree.

Requires Unity v.5.6
